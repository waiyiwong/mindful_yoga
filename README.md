 ## **Design**
 ### **Wireframes**  
Wireframe - Homepage Desktop & Mobile
![wireframe.png](documentation/wireframe.png)

### **Color Scheme**  
This website used a natural palette of pinks and oranges that were inspired by the hero background image.  I combined these with a darker colour for contrast and readabilty in the text.
  
![colorscheme.png)](documentation/colorscheme.png)
![colorscheme2.png)](documentation/colorscheme2.png)

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) checked how accessible the colours are.  

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Beth Ellen' and 'Roboton'. I used Beth Ellen for h1 headings and Roboton for the main content.

### **Imagery**   
Mindful Yoga use stock and AI images throughout the website, with attributions to the designers placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

### **Navbar and Hero Page**   

Mindful Yoga 

### **Taglines **  

Mindful Yoga -- "Find Your Balance, Feel Your Peace." and "Tranquility Begins Wthin"

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  

To ensure responsivity I used Bootstrap 5.3.3. All elements resize and wrap as necessary, with everything appearing in a column for smaller screens. The header navbar changed to pull-down toggler hamburger icon for smaller screen devices.
