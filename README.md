## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  

- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  

### **2. Scope**  

Mindful YOga

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.   
- Text are clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, content, and contact information.  
  

### **3. Structural**  

It was requested that the design was straightforward, clear and easy to understand with the following features:
 
- A hero section that quicky and clearly describe the purpose of the website.

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

Mindful YOga


### Wireframes  

<summary>Wireframe - Homepage Desktop & Mobile</summary>

### **5. Surface**  

The design was intended and created to evoke a relaxing and safe environment.
 
 ## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

This website used a natural palette of pinks and oranges that were inspired by the hero background image.  I combined these with a darker colour for contrast and readabilty in the text.
  
![colorscheme.png)](assets/images/colorscheme.png)
![colorscheme2.png)](assets/images/colorscheme2.png)

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) checked how accessible the colours are.  

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Beth Ellen' and 'Roboton'. I used Beth Ellen for <h1> headings and Roboton for the main content.

### **Imagery**  
 

Mindful Yoga use stock and AI images throughout the website, with attributions to the designers placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

### **Navbar and Hero Page**   

Mindful Yoga 

### **Taglines **  

Mindful Yoga -- "Find Your Balance, Feel Your Peace." and "Tranquility Begins Wthin"

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  

To ensure responsivity I used Bootstrap 5.3.3. All elements resize and wrap as necessary, with everything appearing in a column for smaller screens. The header navbar changed to pull-down toggler hamburger icon for smaller screen devices.
